        The American composer Philip Glass is considered by some to be one of the most 
        influential contemporary composers.<br>
        <br>
        Associated with minimalism (in music, the use of short ideas which gradually change,
      resulting in an exceptionally hypnotic, layered effect), 
        <br><br>
        Glass himself prefers to describe his work as ‘music with repetitive structures’. 
        <br><br>
        
        Over the course of his 50-year career, he has evolved such repetitive structures 
        to produce a style that is instantly recognisable as a piece of Philip Glass music.

        <h4>Background and Education</h4> 

 He took up the violin and flute and began performing before reaching his teens. 
 Glass took classes at the Peabody Institute’s conservatory and later studied at 
 the University of Chicago and The Juilliard School.

 <h4>Studies With Ravi Shankar</h4>

Glass eventually decided to travel to Europe, 
studying under conductor Nadia Boulanger and sitar
 musician Ravi Shankar, whom Glass cited as a major influence on his 
 craft. He formed the electric Philip Glass Ensemble
  in 1967, an avant-garde group that would continue to earn buzz 
  over the years, if not universal acclaim.

  <h4>Acclaim for 'Einstein'</h4> 

Playwright Robert Wilson worked with the composer to bring Glass’ 
first opera, Einstein on the Beach, to the stage in 1976. Based on
 the life of the famed physicist and relying upon an unorthodox, 
 repeating sonic framework, Einstein earned major acclaim. 
 Many more operas were to come from Glass, including 1980’s 
 Satyagraha, which followed a portion of the life of Mahatma Gandhi.

 <h4>Film Scores</h4> 

Glass has provided scores for a litany of movies that include 
the acclaimed Koyaanisqatsi (1982), a project directed by Godfrey Reggio
 that uses visuals and music to create a story about humanity’s 
 relationship with nature. Other big-screen scores from Glass have
  included Hamburger Hill (1987), Candyman (1992), The Truman Show 
  (1998), Secret Window (2002), The Illusionist (2006), Leviathan
   (2014) and Fantastic Four (2015), as well as documentaries like
    Pandemic: Facing AIDS (2002) and A Sea Change (2009). Glass 
    received Academy Award nominations for the musical scores of
     Kundun (1997), The Hours (2002) and Notes on a Scandal (2006).

     Glass's opening music to the film 'Mishima' has been used in numerous other contexts and media,
    most notably during the finale of 'The Truman Show' for which Glass also contributed to the
    original score.
